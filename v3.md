TODO:

 * Work on hidden inputs?
 * Write up a theme
 * Show why this is a good thing - file button on left and select width
 * Detect/set widths via CSS, not JS
 * Sprite constructor
 * Web based sprite constructor?
 * Select lists need to be REALLY easy to auto size and to fix the size
 * Repeating middles for nicely expanding buttons/select lists
 * Consider placeholder
 * Consider styling textareas
 * Hide content from screen readers with visibility:hidden or HTML tag attribute aria-hidden="true"
 * Disabled and elements get aria-disabled="true" and aria-readonly="true"
 * Checked = aria-checked="true", aria-pressed="true" ??  http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties
 * Copy the 'id' but prefix it with uniformjs
 * Copy the 'title' if that helps with tooltips
 * Monitor 'display' and if 'none' then also hide wrapper
 * Changed all of the browser reset CSS, so make sure it still works.  Especially html5 input type="search" active.
 * Find a great way to specify a class and background position
 * Only write out theme sections if there are base images for them.
 * Test that all things can get focus.  Buttons might need to be visible.
 * Do live HTML monitoring so new inputs are able to be automatically themed.

Version 3 goal:

 * Simplification of how Uniform does its job and more consistency
 * Bug fixes, especially with cross browser compatibility or obscure edge cases
 * Doing things right automatically - `$('body').uniform()` should get you started nicely.  Looks like we might want to pass a default theme in there though.
 * Separate theme concerns better from the base CSS

Version 3 changes:

 * Removal of most options and instead attempt to standardize configuration
 * Standardize how things are wrapped
 * Implement polling so UI elements are automatically updated
 * Split theme images up
 * Let software generate CSS and assemble sprites as needed
 * Changing to more of a flags-based approach with uniform classes
 * Allow more flexibility with themes as you detect element states with whatever CSS you would like
 * Profiling the CPU usage to ensure a high quality experience
 * Removal of jQuery for many internal operations for faster performance
 * Classes are propagated to the wrapper and are watched for changes
 * Permit several new styling possibilities, like right-handed buttons for file uploads and a more natural way to set widths

Version 3 options:

    fileButtonHtml: "Browse"
    fileDefaultHtml: "No file selected"
    resetText: "Reset"
    submitText: "Submit"
    theme:  "Theme name"

Buttons that use inner HTML, wrapped:

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="button-left">
            <div class="button-right">
                <div class="button-middle">This is the button</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <button>This is the button</button>
    </div>

Buttons that use value, wrapped:
Wrapper might have a class of "default" to indicate default text is showing.

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="button-left">
            <div class="button-right">
                <div class="button-middle">Go!</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="Go!" />
    </div>

Checkbox, wrapped:

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="checkbox">
        </div>
        <input type="checkbox" />
    </div>

File selection / uploads, wrapped:
Wrapper might have a class of "default" to indicate default text is showing.

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="file">
            <div class="file-button-left">
                <div class="file-button-right">
                    <div class="file-button-middle">Select File</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="file-filename-left">
                <div class="file-filename-right">
                    <div class="file-filename-middle">No file has been chosen</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="file" />
    </div>

Inputs of various types that are unable to be styled, but they do get wrapped.
The wrapping is a little different as the input is deeper here.  Also, the classes for both the specific type and a generic class are here so you can style particular elements if you desire.

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="input-left input-text-left">
            <div class="input-right input-text-right">
                <div class="input-middle input-text-middle">
                    <input type="text" />
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Radio, wrapped:
No sliding window.

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="radio">
        </div>
        <input type="radio" />
    </div>

Selects that are not multiselects, wrapped:

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="select-left">
            <div class="select-right">
                <div class="select-middle">
                    <div class="select-text">Your currently selected option.</div>
                    <div class="select-options">
                        Option 1
                        Option 2
                        Your currently selected option.
                        Option 4
                        Option 5
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <select>
            <option>Option 1</option>
            <option>Option 2</option>
            <option>Your currently selected option.</option>
            <option>Option 4</option>
            <option>Option 5</option>
        </select>
    </div>

Selects that are multiselects, wrapped:
Note that the input is embedded deeper here.

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="multiselect-left">
            <div class="multiselect-right">
                <div class="multiselect-middle">
                    <select size=2>...</select>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Textarea, wrapped:
Note that the input is embedded deeper here.

    <div class="uniformjs your-theme-name">
        <div class="textarea-left">
            <div class="textarea-right">
                <div class="textarea-middle">
                    <textarea></textarea>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Classes applied by element status to the wrapper div (the one with the `uniformjs` class):

 * .active - The mouse or a touch event is actively using this element
 * .checked - Checkbox or radio that is selected.  Automatically updated through polling and can be manually updated.
 * .default - Using a default value for submit/reset buttons or the default text for a file upload with no file selected.
 * .disabled - Element has the `disabled` attribute or property set.
 * .focus - User has most recently used the element or has tabbed over to it.  Automatically updated through events.
 * .hidden - Element is not visible.
 * .hover - Mouse is above the element.  Automatically updated through events.  Similar to the :hover pseudo-selector, but this works in IE8.
 * .indeterminate - Checkbox or radio is in an indeterminate state (special HTML attribute)
 * .readonly - Element has the `readonly` attribute or property
 * .required - Element has the `required` attribute or property

In addition to these, all classes from the wrapped element are also copied up to the wrapper.
