* Check demo page in as many browsers as possible
* Run code through jslint until it's squeaky clean
* Enhance demo page to show all sorts of edge cases, like when bugs were
  found.  shidec has IE7 fixes with uniformed 'a' elements, which might
  be needed if they are still broken.
* Reduce $() calls, like dcneiner, aki-russia
* Add minified version in again, but test YUI, Google, Microsoft
* Add tests.  szaboat added Jasmine tests.  May wish to be more thorough?
  Not browser based?
* Add another demo page or maybe break into a few pages so different sprite
  images can be shown off.
